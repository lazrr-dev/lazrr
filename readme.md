# lazrr

Disclaimer: This project should be used for authorized testing or educational purposes only.

### Examples:

- Fill infinitely many forms using default amount of threads (which is 4):

    `
        python3 lazrr.py https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/.../viewform
    `

- Fill at least 777 forms using 10 threads:

    `
        python3 lazrr.py -t 10 -f 777 https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/.../viewform
    `

# Experimental: libfuzzer extra kek

#### Keep in mind that this feature is experimental, and text generated by libfuzzer may be invalid for filling the form.

So, we use libfuzzer to generate random inputs.

Installation:

`
    sudo apt-get install clang
`

or any other way to install clang to your system.

Compilation:

`
    clang fuzzing_launcher.cpp -o lazrr -fsanitize=fuzzer,address
`

Usage:

Set the google form address in gform.txt. Set the initial corpus for libfuzzer in corpus directory. libfuzzer will generate random responses based on files in corpus. By default the corpus consists of `responses[sample].txt` with some additions.

Launch lazrr with:

`
   ./lazrr --jobs=1 --workers=1 corpus --only_ascii=1 --reduce_inputs=0 --len_control=0
`
